              Deep Institute of Community Ophthalmology (DICO) is the training and research wing of
              Deep Eye Care Foundation (DECF). Established in 2017, DICOâ€™s mission to eliminate
              needless blindness and make a sustainable, equitable, and comprehensive health care
              system has led to the development of human resources for our own hospitals as well as
              the country. DICO imparts training for ophthalmologists, Mid-level ophthalmic personnel
              (MLOP), Outreach workers, Healthcare managers, and Researchers. The general framework
              for our training courses is to make them interactive and hands-on so that participants
              can derive the most benefit from their time spent with us. The Institute has been
              recognized by the Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Govt. of the People's Republic
              of Bangladesh & affiliated by the State Medical Faculty of Bangladesh.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The course provides knowledge, skills, and attitude through which MLOPs will be able to
            assist the ophthalmologist and render primary eye care services with efficiency and
            accuracy where necessary within the defined boundary of responsibilities. The students
            having passed in SSC (science background preferred) are selected to undergo comprehensive
            theoretical and practical training in Ophthalmic procedures. After successful completion
            of the course, we provide the opportunity for employment at DECF. The course is affiliated
