                            The retina is a thin tissue layer located in the back of each of our eyes near the optic nerve.
                            It is composed of alternating layers of cells in order to best interpret and direct the light
                            coming in through our eyes. Itâ€™s an important part of our eye that assists in processing light
                            and sending signals to our brain to help translate what we see. It is essential to our vision,
                            and diseases and conditions affecting the retina can lead to permanent blindness. Vitreo Retina
                            department deals with the patients having vitreo-retinal disorders that can be managed medically
                            or by surgical intervention. The department is equipped with modern facilities like Fluorescein
                            angiography, Optical Coherence Tomography, Color Fundus Photography, and Laser services. The
