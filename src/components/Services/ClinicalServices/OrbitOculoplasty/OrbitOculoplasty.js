                            The department of Orbit & Oculoplasty offers comprehensive treatment to various problems
                            affecting the orbit of the eye. Orbit refers to the eye-socket (the cavity in the skull that
                            holds the eye) and the surrounding structures. Diseases of the Orbit may arise from within
                            the eye-socket or might be a secondary condition arising out of an existing illness. While
                            some of these issues could be cosmetic, quite a few of orbital problems might affect the
                            regular functioning of the eyes. Thereâ€™s sure relief for these conditions, and oculoplasty
                            is a cosmetic/reconstructive surgical procedure that comes to the rescue of patients with
                            eye orbit problems. Annually around 6000 patients are provided service through this department
                            and around 2500 surgeries are performed.
