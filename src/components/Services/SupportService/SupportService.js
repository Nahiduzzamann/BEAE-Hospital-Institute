        <p className="mb-4">
          Quality eye care services usually be costly since equipment and
          instruments used for providing eye care services are exorbitantly
          expensive and it is one of the prime roots that cause obstacles to
          reducing the number of blindness at a desired pace. Actually a proper
          maintenance and taking care of these equipment and instruments help
          provide both cost effective and efficient eye care services to the
          people by expanding their life span and making them work smoothly and
          accurately. BEAE Hospital has integrated Biomedical Engineering Department into
          the organization and had several of its personnel properly trained
          from Aravind Eye Care System, India to run the department.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Low vision exists when ordinary glasses, contact lenses, medical
            treatment, and/or surgery cannot fully correct vision. Unlike total
            blindness, people with low vision have some useful vision. However,
            vision loss interferes with their ability to complete tasks of
            everyday life – such as reading, recognizing faces, cooking, driving,
            and differentiating color. Our comprehensive, multi-disciplinary
            approach to care provides a team of specialists — from ophthalmologists
            to optometrists to Orthoptists — who are trained to evaluate your
            condition and to learn about tools and assistive technology available
            to help you meet the demands of daily living.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Medical records are used to record the patient’s problem, history, and
          treatment given either as out-patient or in-patient. It gives
          continuity in treating the patient during subsequent visits or
          admission. The medical record department (MRD) is responsible for
          proper maintaining of these medical records. MRD also assists in
          protecting the legal interests of the patient, the hospital, and the
          doctors. It also provides data for any research, study, or education.

        {/* Add image here */}
        <p className="mb-4">
          Patient counseling is an important part of medical or surgical
          management of a disease. Counseling is very much needed by patients
          who need surgical treatment. Counselors give very good feedback to the
          hospital management regarding patient care facilities. Counseling
          improves the quality of service and builds up the confidence of
          patients, which in turn increases motivation in the community to
          receive eye care services and to accept IOL surgery. Counselors do not
          give advice, but help Patients to make their own choices. BEAE Hospital has
          separate counselors for Cataract, Retina, Orbit & Oculoplasty, and
          Pediatric Ophthalmology departments. The counselors were trained from
          Chittagong Eye Infirmary & Training Complex (CEITC).
