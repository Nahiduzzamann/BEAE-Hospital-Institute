        <p className="mb-4">
          BEAE Hospital lays emphasis on outreach programs as they open up the scope of
          serving the most vulnerable and impoverished segments of the society
          living in remote and lagging behind areas. This is where the hammer of
          blindness falls the hardest. Poor families find it increasingly
          difficult to survive with someone disabled by treatable blindness.
          Most of our hospitals and eye care centers are located in towns and
          cities, and owing to their financial strain and lack of awareness,
          poor people usually don’t visit those. As blindness leaves those poor
          people incomeless and jobless, BEAE Hospital prioritizes the importance of
          conducting outreach programs as frequently as possible to ensure
          primary eye care services within easy reach of those deprived. We give
          special emphasis to outreach programs as it helps develop awareness
          among the people where BCC materials are used to bring the desired
          effect. With a span of 10 years, BEAE Hospital has conducted more than ____ Free
          camps, Health awareness programs, school screenings, DR camps etc.
          BEAE Hospital has also extended its helping hand for conducting around ____ free
          surgeries to the underprivileged in the society.

        {/* Add image here */}
        <p className="mb-4">
          During the last one year (January 2018 – December 2018), BEAE Hospital
          organized a total of 52 School Sight Testing Programs in different
          schools within Rangpur District for screening children. In this year,
          a total of 39,913 students were screened in SSTP. In the screening
          camps, we identified refractive errors and prescribed medicine. We
          delivered 767 free spectacles among the refractive poor patients. We
          provided few drugs to the poor patients under this project. We
          referred 78 students with operational and critical cases to the Base
          Hospital. In this quarter, several pediatric cataract surgeries were
          also done through SSTP.

          Drishti Corner is set up at school premises to increase the access to
          eye screenings to ensure that no child gets missed and can enjoy
          studying, reading, playing without worrying about their sight. At the
          selected school premises, a special corner will be chosen by the
          management of the school for implementing "Dristi Corner". Twenty
          schools were selected primarily for setting up Drishti Corner. BEAE Hospital
